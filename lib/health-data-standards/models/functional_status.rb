# This class can be used to represnt a functional status for a patient. Currently,
# it is not a very close representation of functional status as it is represented
# in the HL7 CCD, HITSP C32 or Consolidated CDA.
#
# In the previously mentioned specifications, functional status may represented
# using either a condition or result. Having "mixed" types of entries in a section
# is currently not well supported in the existing Record class
#
# Additionally, there is a mismatch between the data needed to calculate Stage 2
# Meaningful Use Quailty Measures and the data contained in patient summary
# standards. The CQMs are checking to see if a functional status represented by
# a result was patient supplied. Right now, results do not have a source, and
# even if we were to use Provider as a source, it would need to be extended
# to support patients.
#
# To avoid this, the patient sumamry style functional status has been "flattened"
# into this class. This model supports the information needed to calculate
# Stage 2 MU CQMs. If importers are created from C32 or CCDA, the information
# can be stored here, but it will be a lossy transformation.
module HealthDataStandards
  class FunctionalStatus < HealthDataStandards::Entry
    # Either "condition" or "result"
    field :type, type: String
    # A coded value. Like a code for patient supplied.
