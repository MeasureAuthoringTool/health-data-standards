  # This is used for Medicaton, Order. It is the total number of times a dose of a particular
  # medication can be administered. This, coupled with the administrationTiming will
  # give the cumulative medication duration.
  # E.g.
  #  allowedAdministrations = 90 doses
  #  administrationTiming = 1 dose / 12 hours
  #  cumulativeMedicationDuration = allowedAdministrations / administrationTiming * (time conversion)
  #  cumulativeMedicationDuration = (90 doses) * (12 hours)/(1 dose) * (1 day)/(24 hours) = 45 days
  # Medication, Order can't use fulfillmentHistory because the fulfillment of the 
  # medication has not yet happened.
  # This corresponds to 'repeatNumber' in the QRDA representation
  field :allowedAdministrations, as: :allowed_administrations, type: Integer

  # There are currently no importers that support this field
  # It is expected to be a scalar and value, such as 7 days
