This is a project to generate and consume HITSP C32, ASTM CCR, QRDA Category I, QRDA Category III and PQRI.

In addition this project also contains libaries for parsing HQMF documents and for dealing with NLM valuesets.

Environment
===========

This project currently uses Ruby 1.9.3, Ruby 2.0.0 and JRuby 1.7.5 and is built using [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/). To get all of the dependencies for the project, first install bundler:

    gem install bundler

Then run bundler to grab all of the necessary gems:

    bundle install

The Quality Measure engine relies on a MongoDB [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) running a minimum of version 2.4.* or higher.  To get and install Mongo refer to:

    http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Quickstart
